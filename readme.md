VAHLE’s MKH is a fully enclosed conductor bar (Powerail) solution for 
indoor and outdoor use. The insulated “honey comb” design of the housing 
can accommodate various copper profiles depending on amperage 
requirements. Three models of MKH exist with characteristics suitable to 
many different applications. 
TYPE MKHD: 6 to 10 copper conductors version with continuous copper 
strips. Rated at 40 to 160 amps. Copper strips supplied as separate coils 
to be installed on site. 
TYPE MKHF: 6 to 8 conductor version with pre-installed copper 
conductors and spring loaded joint connectors. Supplied in 4 meter 
lengths. Can be cut to size as required. Rated at 40 to 100 amps. 
TYPE MKHS: 6 to 8 conductor version with pre-installed copper 
conductors and bolted joint connectors. Supplied in 4 meter lengths. Can 
be cut to size as required. Rated at 40 to 200 amps. 
MKH’s main features include a compact design, resistance to corrosion, 
high user safety, and ease of installation. MKH complies with VDE, 
European and international standards, as well as accident prevention 
regulations. It is protected to IP 23 standards and UL approved. 
MKH benefits from a variety of VAHLE exclusive accessories that allow it 
to adapt to any application. Accessories include sealing strip, an internal 
heating system and specialty sections (see respective pages). With the 
optional sealing strip installed, MKH is protected to IP 24 standards and 
EN 605296 (0470, part) regulation. 
Important safety information: If there is the possibility to touch live 
parts by hand, i.e. collectors that might leave the conductor bar during 
operation, provide safety barrier and/or disconnect mains. Collectors are 
safe against touch only when fully entered into the conductor system. 
This is valid only for a supply voltage exceeding 24 V AC or 60 V DC. Low 
voltages of max. 50 V AC or 120 V DC are allowable only if the conductor 
system is used as a control line (type “SS”). Refer to regulation SELV or 
PELV (also DIN VDE 0100 410). A ground conductor is required for higher 
voltages.
